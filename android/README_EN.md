# TrustAttestor Android

TrustAttestor Android is the local scanning client. It collects evidence from Android Key Attestation, KeyMint/Keystore, system integrity, mount/process state, and controlled native probes. Each check keeps a stable `probeId`, state, evidence, and availability reason.

The current client is **v1.5** (`versionCode 15`), supports Android 8.1 / API 27 and later, and release builds target `arm64-v8a`.

> Results describe evidence observable by this implementation on the current device and system. OEM KeyMint behavior, ROM, kernel, permissions, and load can make probes unavailable. `UNAVAILABLE` is neither an anomaly nor a pass.

## Result states

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `CLEAN` | The probe completed and found none of its defined anomaly evidence |
| `DETECTED` | The rule found repeatable, explainable evidence that meets its threshold |
| `WARNING` | A signal needs attention but is not strong enough to classify as an anomaly |
| `UNAVAILABLE` | Unsupported platform, missing permission, timeout, interface failure, or incomplete evidence |

Only `DETECTED` contributes to the anomaly count. A failed or unsupported probe must remain `UNAVAILABLE`.

## Detection areas

### Device environment

The native checker reads system calls, `/proc`, mount information, properties, and controlled child-process behavior:

- bootloader/VBMeta properties, encryption state, debug ramdisk, hidden ext4 loop images, and mount remnants;
- `su`, BusyBox, Shizuku, GameGuardian, ADB-root, KernelSU/APatch driver or UAPI traces, and Zygisk-related mount/process evidence;
- mount source/target/filesystem, propagation and peer-group relationships, namespace differences, and incFS/vendor-layout compatibility gates;
- property-area consistency, `/proc` access chains/timing, kernel identity (`uname`/`/proc`/Java), process reaping, executable mappings, and runtime injection paths;
- TeeSim/RS-Soter endpoints and service/policy traces, without treating an absent optional service as proof of tampering.

Example IDs include `device.root.kernelsu`, `system.mount.peer_group`, `system.mount.inconsistent`, `system.readproc.tricky_store`, and `device.kernel.identity_spoofing`.

### System integrity

This layer checks more than well-known root paths:

- APK package/code/resource paths, signing-block structure, mapping inode, native identity, and runtime loader paths;
- SELinux enforcing state, policy views and status channels, `system_server` executable memory, and Magisk/KernelSU/APatch/LSPosed/Xposed/Zygisk policy traces;
- App Zygote and isolated-process service/interface/Binder boundaries, process start/reap behavior, and authorization-chain availability;
- executable anonymous memory, runtime injection, system-server hooks, Sui/superuser services, and LSPosed bridges.

Example IDs include `system.selinux.permissive`, `system.selinux.kernelsu_policy`, `system.app_zygote.process`, `system.app_zygote.sepolicy`, `system.permission.boundary`, and `system.runtime.injection_path`.

### Hardware attestation

The client creates temporary keys for each invocation and cleans them up. It does not inspect user-owned key material:

- X.509 chain, trust anchor, signature graph, validity, leaf constraints, application identity, signing lineage, patch levels, KeyMint/Keymaster version, and security level;
- Root of Trust fields (`deviceLocked`, verified boot state/key, and VBMeta digest) compared with `ro.boot.*` and build properties;
- capability-gated Device Properties differential checks with challenge, ordinary-key control, retry, and repeatability rules;
- AttestKey chain structure and Keystore2 `KEY_ID` descriptor delegation, including incomplete/negative key IDs, delegated signing output, service substitution, and source consistency;
- challenge/authorization boundary probes, StrongBox-vs-TEE differentials, user-auth metadata/policy, and key metadata/security-level checks;
- RSA-PSS/OAEP, AES-GCM/CBC, HMAC, ECDH/ECDSA legal round trips, chunking, AAD/tag integrity, digest/padding constraints, and negative inputs;
- Keystore ledger/state machine, alias isolation, cross-signing, certificate-record round trips, Binder locality, interface tokens, single-use policy, read-path timing, and same-device timing controls;
- repeatable KeyMint/TEE parameter fingerprints, distinguishing actual constraint conflicts from ProviderException, resource contention, or insufficient samples.

Example IDs include `hardware.attestation.device_properties`, `hardware.attestation.root_of_trust_state`, `hardware.attestation.attest_key_descriptor_delegation`, `hardware.attestation.strongbox_differential`, `hardware.attestation.user_auth_policy`, `hardware.attestation.parameter_fingerprint`, `hardware.attestation.teesim_parameter_fingerprint`, `hardware.attestation.keystore_ledger`, and `hardware.attestation.keystore_timing`.

### Optional cloud attestation (L3)

After consent, the client creates a one-time challenge, sends only the data required by the configured service, and verifies the returned P-256 signature locally. The service verifies the chain, challenge, application identity, revocation/Keybox rules, TEE intermediate-CA RDN encoding profiles, device/build consistency, kernel policy, and reviewed observation consensus. Missing data or policy returns `UNAVAILABLE`, not an automatic anomaly. See [`../cloud/README_EN.md`](../cloud/README_EN.md).

`app/src/main/cpp/external/fmt` is a Git submodule. Clone with `--recurse-submodules` or run `git submodule update --init --recursive`.

## Compatibility and build

Requirements: JDK 17, Android SDK Platform 35, Build Tools 35.0.0 (the DEX flow also reads the 35.0.1 `d8.jar`), NDK 27.2.12479018, and SDK CMake. The SDK can come from Android Studio or the Android SDK environment; `local.properties` is machine-local and must not be committed.

```properties
sdk.dir=/absolute/path/to/Android/Sdk
```

Both Debug and Release builds must use the external signing configuration that is used for the
production package. This keeps the signer fingerprint identical across variants and prevents the
native signer-identity gate from treating a Debug package as a different application.

```powershell
# Gradle state, project caches, Kotlin state, CMake staging, DEX, mappings,
# and APKs are written to the external TrustAttestor-build directory.
.\build-external.ps1 -Variant debug `
  -SigningProperties 'C:\private\TrustAttestor\android\keystore.properties'
```

Release:

```powershell
.\build-external.ps1 -Variant release `
  -SigningProperties 'C:\private\TrustAttestor\android\keystore.properties'
```

Direct `gradlew.bat` invocations also default their Gradle user directory, temporary directory, and project cache to the external build root. Keep signing files and all generated artifacts outside the repository.

The project uses the standard Android Gradle Plugin R8/D8 pipeline. Skidfuscator, LSParanoid, OLLVM, and detector-embedded anti-debug configuration have been removed. The standalone anti-debug example is not part of this client.

## UI preview and privacy

`TrustAttestor-UI` is a standalone UI/text/animation preview. It does not load the native detector, access production services, or perform real device checks; see [`TrustAttestor-UI/README.md`](TrustAttestor-UI/README.md).

L0–L2 run locally. L3 is opt-in. Do not commit signing keys, `.dev.vars`, Cloudflare private keys, real Keyboxes, or identifiable device reports. Report security issues privately through GitHub Security Advisory.
